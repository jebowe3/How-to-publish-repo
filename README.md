# How to publish your map project with a sharable link

Steps for publishing your repo and getting a sharable link for your map project

## Step 1: Merge your branch repo with the master (if your branch holds the final version)

If one of your branch repositories holds the final version of your map project, you will want to merge this branch into the master repository and delete any remaining branch repositories. This is merely a hygienic step to alleviate confusion when you return to your project at a later date. If you like things sloppy, you can always publish the branch!

The first step is to open GitHub Desktop. Select the master branch in the "Current Branch" tab.

Return to the "Current Branch" tab. At the bottom, you should see an option for "Choose a branch to merge into master." Click this and select the branch containing the final (or most up to date) version of your project.

Now, press the button that says "Merge branch-name into master."

Open and resolve any conflicts in Atom and commit the merge.

Now, get on the worldwide web and surf to your GitHub repository. Towards the top, you should be able to see a button that says "# branches." Click this.

You will see a list of branches in your repository with some red trashcan icon to the right. Click on the trashcan next to the branch you want to delete. Be careful not to delete the master!

Now your repository is much cleaner and ready to publish.

## Step 2: Make your repository public

In your online repository, find and click the "Settings" option.

Scroll down to "Danger Zone."

You will then see a warning. In this dialogue box, choose "Make public," type the name of your repo in the text box, and click "I understand..." at the bottom.

Now you are ready to publish a page.

## Step 3: Publishing to GitHub Pages

Remaining on the Settings options page, locate "GitHub Pages" and choose "master" under "Source." To the right of this, click "Save."

Once you click "Save," scroll back down to "GitHub Pages." You should now see a link next to "Your site is ready to be published at..." If nothing appears after you click the link, wait a few minutes. It takes a little while for your page to be ready. Once it is, you can share and embed your map as your please.
